1. Running into issues for Mongo. Worked on fixing them.
2. Deployed the initial setup on EC2 successfully.
3. Worked on architecting the design for Manage Orders API.

Retrospective
1. Decided to catch up on Zoom to explain the project setup. 
Later cancelled the meeting as working remotely is not helping us clarify each other's doubts better. 
Decided to spend time after class.
