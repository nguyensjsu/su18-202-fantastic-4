1. Tried deploying jar file using Elastic Beanstalk but was not succesful so worked with Anushri for manual EC2 deployment 
   and then configuring AutoScaling group and Elastic Load Balancer for it.
2. Working on the redesign of Architetcure Diagram with Anu.

Retrospective
1. We had zoom call discussed various blockers and tried resolving majority of them.
2. I got a clearer picture on EC2 deployment and configuring AutoScaling group and Elastic Load Balancer.
