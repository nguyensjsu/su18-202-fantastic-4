### Anushri

1. Discussed with Paul and team about the right way of doing Burndown Charts, Scrum updates and recording XP Value observations.
2. Explained to team in person the overview of the entire project setup and gave a code walk through.
3. Discussed with team things that were wrong over the last week and spent time on planning the right thing moving forward.

Retrospective
1. Zoom meetings and planning on whatsapp is not helping in achieving the desired progress. 
2. We as a team were able to pick up things faster when we met in class on Saturday.
3. Made good progress post lecture with respect to API designing and clarifications.
4. Team has a better clarity and are more focussed now.
